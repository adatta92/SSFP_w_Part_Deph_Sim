# SSFP_w_Part_Deph_Sim
Bloch simulation code for SSFP with partial dephasing for flow-artifact mitigation.

This code was used in 

A. Datta, C. A. Baron, J. Y. Cheng, and D. G. Nishimura, “Mitigation of bSSFP flow artifacts using partial dephasing,” submitted to 25th Annual Meeting of ISMRM 2017 (in press).

(Please see the pdf in this folder).

The code is written in MATLAB.  PartialDephasing.m and PartialDephasingPulsatile.m call part_dep_sim_parallel.m and part_dep_sim_pulsatile.m, respectively.
